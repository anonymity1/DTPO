# Dynamic-Tempo Predict+Optimize (DTPO): Eanching Constrained Optimization with unknown parameters in Time-Sensitive Decision Environments

This repository contains the code and data for our paper: Dynamic-Tempo Predict+Optimize (DTPO)

## Overview

In the landscape of optimization under uncertainty, the conventional Predict+Optimize framework plays a crucial role, yet its efficiency in time-sensitive decision environments necessitates further enhancement, especially concerning decision timing. Existing methodologies typically depend on fixed decision intervals, determined empirically by designers, which we argue can lead to suboptimal cumulative outcomes in optimization objectives. This paper introduces the Dynamic-Tempo Predict+Optimize framework, a novel approach that transcends traditional static interval constraints by dynamically adjusting decision tempos in response to ever-changing environments.
Our framework uniquely integrates time series forecasting with confidence estimation, enabling a more nuanced assessment of various decision scenarios. Evaluations in varied settings reveal the Dynamic-Tempo Predict+Optimize framework's superior capability in achieving optimal outcomes, particularly in scenarios where timing plays a pivotal role.
